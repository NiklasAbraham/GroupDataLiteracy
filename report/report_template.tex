\begin{abstract}
We analyze semantic evolution in cinema by embedding movie plot summaries (1930-2024) into a unified semantic space. Using distance distributions, novelty scores, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we quantify temporal shifts in narrative structures, revealing overall semantic stability alongside distinct emergence patterns in specific subgenres.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Cinema provides a rich archive of narrative structures that encode evolving societal values across generations. Previous approaches employ keyword search or topic modelling \cite{dubourg2023cinema} to explore temporal trends in movie plots. While these older methods might be insightful but challenging, recent computational work \cite{xu2020cinderella} has revealed hidden cultural patterns in large narrative corpora. One such analysis conducted on the musical domain uses high dimensional embeddings to observe changes to structural properties over time \cite{DiMarco2025}. We build upon these foundations by leveraging advances in large language models (LLMs) to embed movie plot summaries \cite{sreenivasan2013quantitative} into a unified semantic space. Using novel statistical methods, we quantitatively analyze how movie narratives evolve over time.
Common public sentiment is that the film industry is \textit{"running out of ideas"} resulting in movies that are becoming less creative and more similar to each other over time. We analyze this claim...?

\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Data Collection}

The initial dataset was constructed by querying Wikidata, an open knowledge graph structured as a network of items, connected together by properties. We used its SPARQL API to extract items classified as films with release dates ranging from 1930 to 2024. In order to adhere to Wikidata's query size limitations, we gathered the data iteratively by release year. We first retrieved QIDs of items describing feature films, then processed them in small batches to gather the rest of relevant features including title, release date, duration, genres, directors, actors, English Wikipedia link, and very importantly links to external movie databases TMDb and IMDb. During collection of QIDs, items classified as short film or television series episode were excluded, and final filtering of non-feature films was performed during data cleaning.

Second, we enriched the dataset using TMDb, a community-driven database that offers quantitative measures of popularity and user engagement. Wikidata's external identifiers enabled direct mapping to TMDb entries, from which we programmatically retrieved vote counts, vote averages, and popularity metrics for each film. These measures served as proxies for audience engagement and cultural impact, informing downstream film filtering and weighting.

The third stage, the most data-intensive, focused on obtaining full-text plot summaries. Leveraging Wikipedia sitelinks from Wikidata, we accessed each film's Wikipedia page to extract the plot section. Wikipedia's editorial standards ensure relatively uniform and neutral plot descriptions, facilitating standardized comparative semantic analysis. This step used the Wikipedia API for article retrieval, section extraction, and text normalization, transforming metadata into the dense textual data required for downstream embedding.

The last enrichment stage addressed limitations in TMDb voting statistics. Many movies in the corpus lacked TMDb ratings or vote counts, and when available, these counts were often substantially lower than those reported by other platforms. To address this issue, we enriched the dataset with IMDb vote averages and vote counts, obtained from IMDb's non-commercial data files and merged using the IMDb title identifier. The inclusion of IMDb data ensures broader coverage and higher vote volumes, resulting in a more stable measure of audience reception.

All data sources are open and appropriately licensed. Wikidata \cite{wikidata} is released under CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain). Wikipedia \cite{wikipedia} is under CC BY SA 4.0, and TMDb \cite{tmdb} under CC BY NC 4.0, allowing non-commercial research with attribution. This ensures reproducibility and legal compliance.

After the data was collected in a tabular format, the textual plot descriptions required transformation into vector representations via a suitable embedding model for downstream analysis. The plot descriptions extracted from Wikipedia pages exhibit substantial variability in length, ranging from 10 to 20,479 characters, corresponding to approximately 6 to 5,296 tokens in an English tokenizer. All plot descriptions in our corpus are in English, which simplifies the embedding process by eliminating cross-lingual considerations. After performing the explicitly described data pipeline steps, the final dataset contained 141{,}119 data points (movies) with an average coverage of 81\% in the categories of actors, directors, genres, and year.

\subsection{Data cleaning}

After collecting the raw movie data from Wikidata, TMDb and Wikipedia, we first ensured that our dataset does not contain any duplicates with respect to Wikidata QIDs and Wikipedia links, and then applied several filtering steps described in Figure \ref{fig:data_cleaning_funnel}.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Filtering out movies without a Wikipedia plot.}
%     \item \textbf{Removal of non-feature movies based on the Wikidata class.}
%     \item \textbf{Filtering out movies with excessively long plots.} We filtered out movies with plots longer than 14,000 characters from our dataset because these plots are labeled by Wikipedia as \textit{excessively long}.
%     \item \textbf{Removal of movies with low entropy plots.}
%     \item \textbf{Exclusion of explicit content.} We excluded movies whose primary genres fell within explicit or highly exploitative categories, such as Bavarian porn, Nazi exploitation, erotic film, and related genres. These categories were removed in order to focus our analysis on mainstream cinematic narratives and because including them would not have been appropriate or useful for a university project of this scope.
% \end{itemize}


The most critical filtering step was the removal of movies with low-entropy plots. Raw dataset contained a significant number of incomplete or overly brief plots (e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_(2013_film)}{this}). To identify and remove such movies we employed a filtering method inspired by \cite{wenzek2019ccnetextractinghighquality}, who used perplexity of a Large Language model to filter out low quality documents. While \cite{wenzek2019ccnetextractinghighquality} utilized perplexity of a 5 gram language model trained on high quality data, we tokenized the plots with the BGE-M3 tokenizer and compute the Shannon entropy of the token distribution for each plot. To determine the optimal entropy threshold, we sampled 150 movies from the borderline entropy region of $[4.0, 5.5]$ and manually annotated them as either \textit{good} or \textit{bad} quality. The threshold of $4.8398$ was chosen to maximize the $F\beta$ score with $\beta=0.5$ prioritizing precision over recall.

    \caption{Data cleaning pipeline: number of movies retained after each filtering step.}
    \label{fig:data_cleaning_funnel}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Embedding of the movie plot summaries}

For embedding, we selected the BGE-M3 model \cite{chen2024bgem3embeddingmultilingualmultifunctionality} based on its strong showing (28th place) on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard}}. BGE-M3 is compact (0.5B parameters), supports 8,192-token context length, and can embed entire movie plots in a single vector.

We use a single static model for all time periods to ensure unified representation in a common latent space. Since Wikipedia summaries are modern English (maintained since 2001), linguistic drift is negligible. After evaluating chunking and pooling methods \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805, pmlr-v97-gong19a, raffel2023exploringlimitstransferlearning}, we selected CLS Token (details: \cite{our_github_repo}).

\subsubsection{Internal data validation}

To check that the embeddings meaningfully represent plot similarity, we measured cosine distances within and outside major movie franchises (Harry Potter, Star Wars, James Bond). Movies from the same franchise consistently clustered closer together (e.g., Harry Potter: 0.21 inner-group distance vs. 0.57 to random movies), while the global average distance between any two movies was 0.52. This confirms that the embeddings capture true semantic similarity.

\subsubsection{Genre Taxonomy}

The raw dataset included 975 unique genre labels, many of which were redundant or highly similar. To simplify and standardize the taxonomy, we first removed genres that appeared only once, reducing the set to 463. We then embedded the Wikipedia descriptions (available for 359 genres) using the BGE-M3 model, and clustered these vectors with $k=20$ using k-means. Each cluster was manually labeled based on thematic similarity, resulting in 20 coherent genre categories used in further analyses.


\subsection{Methodology}

After the data was collected and cleaned, the first step was to embed the movie plot summaries into a semantic space.

\subsubsection{Distance analysis}

Once movie plots are embedded into a unified semantic space, quantitative analysis of their geometric relationships becomes possible through distance metrics. The cosine distance between embeddings provides a natural measure of semantic dissimilarity, enabling the construction of cumulative distribution functions over pairwise distances within defined subsets of the corpus.

As movie genres provide a meaningful taxonomy with potential temporal evolution patterns, we examine semantic drift across different time periods of an arbitrary number of years. To this end, embeddings are first grouped by genre $g$ into discrete time periods $\tau$, forming the set $\mathcal{M}_g^{(\tau)}$ of plot embeddings. For each group, two alternative representative embeddings are computed: the \textbf{centroid} (arithmetic mean) $\bar{\mathbf{e}}_g^{(\tau)}$ and the \textbf{medoid} (cosine distance minimizer embedding) $\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_g^{(\tau)}$. We computed the following metrics to analyse the drift dynamics across the groups:

\textbf{Genre drift and acceleration: }drift measures the cosine distance between representative embeddings of consecutive periods, capturing how much a genre's semantic center evolves over two time periods. Acceleration quantifies the change in drift between consecutive periods.

\textbf{Inter-genre distance: }determines cosine distance between representatives of each pair of genres for each time period, enabling pairwise comparison between specific genres.

Since our dataset contains significantly more movies in later years, the medoid and centroid embedding estimators are heavily affected by sampling variance. To mitigate this, we downsample to ensure equal sampling error across all genre-year groups and apply bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals. 

\subsubsection{Novelty analysis}

To investigate the claim that movies are becoming less novel over time, we developed a metric for novelty defined as the minimal cosine distance between a specific movie's plot embedding and the embeddings of all movies in the dataset released prior to it. This can be formally written as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Novelty}(m_i) = \min_{j: year_j < year_i} \left( 1 - \frac{E(m_i) \cdot E(m_j)}{\|E(m_i)\| \|E(m_j)\|} \right)
\end{equation} 

where \( E(m) \) denotes the embedding vector of a movie's plot.
Intuitively, a higher novelty score indicates that the movie's plot is more dissimilar from prior movies, while a lower score implies existence of a very similar movie released earlier.
To compute these scores, we used the Faiss library \cite{douze2024faiss} to efficiently find the preceding nearest neighbors of movie plot embeddings based on the cosine distance.

\subsubsection{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test}

To compare distance distributions across movie subsets (e.g., different decades or genres), we employ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test \cite{massey1951}. We construct $\epsilon$-balls ($\epsilon \in [0.24, 0.30]$) around anchor movies representing specific themes, collecting all movies within the distance threshold to define local semantic neighborhoods. We compare distance distributions and temporal CDFs (cumulative distribution functions of release years) within these neighborhoods to a control group (global mean embedding). Divergence indicates temporal shifts: if semantic structure remains stable, distributions should be similar across time periods.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present and interpret the main empirical findings of our analysis on the embedding space of movie plot summaries.

\subsection{General Spatial Analysis}

We begin with an overview of the global structure of the embedding space by examining the pairwise cosine distances between movie embeddings. The distribution of these distances is approximately normal, with a mean cosine distance of $\mu = 0.5195$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 0.0624$, measured over multiple samples. This summarizes the typical dissimilarity between movie plots and serves as a reference point for subsequent analyses.

To assess the extent to which genre labels correspond to distinct regions in the embedding space, we analyzed separation metrics across 19 genres. The overall intra-genre distance (mean cosine distance between movies within the same genre) was 0.5042, while the overall inter-genre distance (mean cosine distance between movies from different genres) was 0.5268. This yields a separation ratio of 1.0448 and a separation gap of 0.0226. The proximity of these values, with inter-genre distances only marginally exceeding intra-genre distances, indicates substantial overlap between genre clusters in the semantic space. This interpretation is further supported by a silhouette score of $-0.0334$, where negative values indicate that genres are not well separated and exhibit significant intermingling. These findings suggest that while embeddings capture semantic similarity, genre boundaries in this high-dimensional space are relatively porous, reflecting the hybrid and overlapping nature of cinematic categorization.


\subsection{Genre drift analysis}

% I could add the plot but it doesn't show shit
After normalization, the cosine distance of each time group representative embedding with respect to the previous one exhibited only random fluctuation with no clear trend; inter-genre analysis yielded the same result. These outcomes suggest that genres may be too broad as analytical categories, with any underlying patterns likely obscured by noise. 

\subsection{Spread analysis}

There were 3 metrics used to analyze the spread of movies each year: (1) Mean L2 norm, (2) Frobenius and (3) Spectral norm of each movie to its yearly centroid as defined in section 3.5. All 3 metrics were computed on centered yearly embeddings (i.e. yearly centroid was subtracted from each movie embedding before computing the norms) \cite{yamagiwa2024norm}. We could not interpret much from the results of this analysis of movie spread over the years. Mean L2 norm and Frobenius norm stayed relatively constant at 0.7 and 12.4 respectively. Spectral norm had a slight increase from 2.1 to 2.8. We interpreted this as the overall spread of movies remaining relatively constant over the years with outliers becoming more polarizing. It was hard to determine what these polarizing axes were, as they changed yearly and were a combination of multiple dimensions.

\subsection{Novelty score}

In order to assess if temporal trends of novelty scores exist, we plot the average novelty score per year alongside scattered individual movie scores in Figure \ref{fig:novelty_over_time}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/novelty_over_time.png}
    \caption{Novelty scores of movies over time. The blue line represents the average novelty score per year, while individual movie scores are shown as scattered points.}
    \label{fig:novelty_over_time}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test}

We illustrate our approach using James Bond films as anchor movies to compare their distance distributions against all other movies. The cumulative distribution of cosine distances from Bond anchors rises steeply only for a small set of closely related films, while most movies remain more distant. This contrasts with the global mean embedding, which is closer on average to all movies, as it represents an average narrative rather than a specific subgenre.

To examine the temporal dimension, we construct cumulative distribution functions of release years for movies within the epsilon ball and compare them to the control group. Figure~\ref{fig:ks_test_temporal_bond} shows that the temporal distributions differ markedly. The left panel reveals a divergence beginning approximately in the 1960s, suggesting that the spy movie subgenre represented by the Bond anchor exhibits a distinct temporal emergence pattern compared to the broader corpus. The right panel displays normalized histograms of movie counts per year for both groups, confirming that the temporal distribution of spy-themed films diverges from the overall temporal distribution of cinema. This temporal divergence indicates that the spy film subgenre experienced a period of increased production and thematic consolidation that is not representative of general cinematic trends during the same period.

\begin{figure}[ht]

Right: Normalized histograms of movie counts per year, revealing distinct temporal patterns in spy film production compared to the broader corpus.}
    \label{fig:ks_test_temporal_bond}
\end{figure}

 % To further validate the methodology, we applied the same framework to movies focused on Middle East conflicts, using anchor movies such as \textit{Black Hawk Down}, \textit{The Hurt Locker}, \textit{Zero Dark Thirty}, and \textit{American Sniper}. Figure~\ref{fig:ks_test_temporal_middle_east} displays the temporal distribution analysis for this thematic category. The temporal shift is even more pronounced than in the spy film case, with the largest divergence occurring prior to the Gulf War period. Following this point, the frequency of movies semantically similar to the anchor movies increases rapidly. This pattern suggests that Middle East conflict films represent a temporally concentrated genre that emerged in response to specific historical events.

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have utilized modern embedding methods and multiple statistical tools to analyze the evolution of movie plot embeddings over nearly a century of cinema. Our findings indicate that while the overall semantic structure of movie plots remains relatively stable, specific thematic subgenres exhibit distinct temporal emergence patterns. 

We must acknowledge the limitations that arise from our data sources. Wikipedia plot summaries, while standardized, may not fully capture the nuances of original narratives, potentially introducing bias. Additionally, our reliance on a single embedding model, while ensuring a unified semantic space, may overlook temporal linguistic shifts. More importantly, the evolution of cinema is not only reflected in plot summaries but also in cinematography, direction, music, feeling, acting and other non-textual elements. Future work could explore multimodal embeddings that integrate visual and auditory features alongside textual data.

All code and data used in this project are openly available in our GitHub repository\cite{our_github_repo} and as a dedicated dataset on Hugging Face\cite{our_data_on_huggingface}.
