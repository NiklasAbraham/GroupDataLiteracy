Review: **_Gene Roddenberry’s first attempt at a new sci-fi series after Star Trek_**

A late 70’s suspended animation test at an underground NASA complex goes awry when some kind of earthquake hits and Dylan Hunt (Alex Cord) wakes up 154 years later in a post-apocalyptic world where he finds himself caught between two societies—the underground Pax and the surface-dwelling mutants, the Tyranians.   

""Genesis II"" (1973) was written/produced by Roddenberry as the pilot to a new sci-fi TV series, but CBS declined to pick it up, wisely opting for the similar Planet of the Apes series. This one has its points of interest, like Mariette Hartley as Lyra-a and Ted Cassidy as Isiah, but it’s dramatically meh. The characters aren’t fleshed out and there’s too little human interest, although Roddenberry obviously planned to improve on this foundation with several episodes in the works. 

Unshaken, Gene reworked one of the episodes ""Poodle Shop"" (which originated from an idea he pitched as “The Pet Shop” in 1964) into a second pilot called “Planet Earth” (1974) with John Saxon in the starring role of Dylan Hunt. 

It also failed to be picked up, but Saxon is more charismatic as the lead and the story is more compelling featuring the return of Ted Cassidy as Isiah and a superior female cast with Janet Margolin and Diana Muldaur, not to mention Johana De Winter in a hairstyle reminiscent of Princess Leia three years before Star Wars debuted.

This one plays like an anemic version of “Beneath the Planet of the Apes” (1970), just without the apes or the action. 

The film runs 1 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot at Warner Brothers Burbank Studios and University of California, Riverside.

Review: To be fair to this biopic of the man who led the Jews from Pharaonic rule in Egypt to the land of Milk and Honey, there has been some serious effort put into the writing. It is less archaic than much of the original biblical text, but it does still manage to convey something of the gravitas of that tome - especially when delivered by Burt Lancaster in the title role. Now true, at times he does over-egg it on the earnestness front, especially towards the end, but for the most part he holds this together remarkably well. He is helped along by the equally rousing oratory of Sir Anthony Quayle who takes on the role of high priest Aaron and by a solid effort from Ingrid Thulin as Miriam. Sadly, though, these three cannot really compensate for the sluggish pace of the whole thing, nor the really pretty lacklustre supporting cast. That’s probably best exemplified by Laurent Terzieff’s weak performance as the Pharoah, but Mariangela Melato doesn’t fare so very much better as Moses’s adopted mother Bithia. It doesn’t compare at all well with DeMille’s “Ten Commandments” (1956) on the lavishness front, but I think it might outdo it on the authenticity front when they travel through the desert eking out an existence from the scraps they can find amongst the brush. It also goes some way to illustrating that all was not always sweetness and light amongst the tribes; that temptation was never far from many a mind and that, as many people may have found from reading the book of Exodus, their lord God wasn’t always the easiest deity to keep sweet! This simply hadn’t the budget nor Gianfranco De Bosio the imagination or vision to create something compelling to watch. It does have it’s moments - thought the parting of the Red Sea maybe isn’t one of them - but it needed a more robust and characterful cast to support the leads and much more succinct and focussed direction."
